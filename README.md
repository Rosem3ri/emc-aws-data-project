<h1>Welcome to the simple-aws documentation!<br><br>This is a work in progress. Don't expect it to be functional</h1>

I'm working on the task of rudimentary data analysis on a dataset that that is just-barely-too-large-for-a-single-computer-to-think-about. The goals for this repository are:<br>
<br>
-familiarize *myself* with git<br>
-provide for the folks on the margin, for whom Amazon Web Services is too much work, but just so.<br>
-Utilize most of Git's regular-awesome features, like allowing my product owner to request functionality or report bugs<br><br><br>
I'm basically wandering aimlessly / blazing my own trail when it comes to open source projects AND Amazon Web Services, so naturally I've decided to make these blunders public. 
<br><br><br>
<h2>Things you might want or need</h2><br>
In order for this repository to be useful for you, you'll probably need to install Python (2.7?) and Boto, actually create an Amazon Web Services account, and make a separate file with your AWS Key ID and Secret Access Key in it. Mine is called "credentials.py" and key() simply returns "AASKKJ23456KJSDJKDF235ESDF" or whatever when I call that function. <br><br>

Please request functionality, suggest how to make this repository more professional, help me add tests, offer me a job, etc.
